This project is a comprehensive C++ application that simulates an ATM and a bank management system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It includes a wide range of features for both regular users (ATM functionalities) and administrative users (bank management functionalities). From the bank management system, users can create client accounts to be used in the ATM. Additionally, the bank management system allows the admin to create accounts for other users and assign specific permissions as needed. With numerous options available throughout the application, it offers a robust experience for managing banking operations efficiently. The data is encrypted before being saved to files, treating them as a database, ensuring security and privacy. Furthermore, the data is persistent and not temporary, providing a stable and reliable storage solution.
