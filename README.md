This project is a comprehensive C++ application that simulates an ATM and a bank management system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.This project was written from scratch in C++ to demonstrate the application of OOP principles and secure data handling. It includes a wide range of features for both regular users (ATM functionalities) and administrative users (bank management functionalities). From the bank management system, users can create client accounts to be used in the ATM. Additionally, the bank management system allows the admin to create accounts for other users and assign specific permissions as needed. With numerous options available throughout the application, it offers a robust experience for managing banking operations efficiently. The data is encrypted before being saved to files, treating them as a database, ensuring security and privacy. Furthermore, the data is persistent and not temporary, providing a stable and reliable storage solution.

*For those accessing the application, the admin account username is 'admin', and the password is 'admin' in the bank management system.* 

When logged in, the admin can start creating users for managing the bank system and giving them their permissions on the system. Additionally, users can create accounts for clients to use in the ATM.

*Features*
ATM Functionalities:
-Balance Inquiry: Check the balance of an account.
-Cash Withdrawal: Withdraw money from an account.

-Fund Transfer: Transfer funds between accounts.
-Account Statement: View recent transactions and account details.

Bank Management Functionalities:
-Admin User Management: Create and manage administrative users with specific permissions.
-Client Account Management: Create and manage client accounts that can be used in the ATM.
-Permissions Assignment: Assign and manage specific permissions for different users.
-Encrypted Data Storage: All data is encrypted before being saved to files, ensuring security and privacy.
-Persistent Storage: Data is stored persistently in files, which are treated as a database, providing stable and reliable storage.
Security Features
Data Encryption: Sensitive data is encrypted before being stored, ensuring that even if the files are accessed, the data remains secure.
Admin Access: The system comes with a predefined admin account with the username 'admin' and the password 'admin'. Admins have the authority to create and manage users and client accounts.
